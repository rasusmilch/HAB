<para>LibAPRS is an Arduino IDE library that makes it easy to send and receive APRS packets with a <ulink url="http://unsigned.io/micromodem">MicroModem</ulink>-compatible modem.</para><para>You can buy a complete modem from <ulink url="http://unsigned.io/shop">my shop</ulink>, or you can build one yourself pretty easily. Take a look at the documentation in the <ulink url="https://github.com/markqvist/MicroModem">MicroModem</ulink> repository for information and getting started guides!</para><para>See the example included in the library for info on how to use it!</para><para><heading level="2">Some features</heading>

</para><para>Place the &quot;LibAPRS&quot; folder (the one in the same folder as this readme file) inside your Arduino &quot;libraries&quot; folder. That&apos;s all!</para><para><heading level="2">Getting started</heading>
</para><para>You should read through the &quot;Basic_usage&quot; example included with the library. It contains an explanation of all the functions and a basic sketch to get you up and running with sending and receiving packets.</para><para><heading level="2">Got bugs?</heading>
</para><para>This library is very early, and being actively developed all the time. This means you should expect to find bugs. If you do, please report them here, so I can fix them! It also means I might have to make changes that will break code, and that you will have to rewrite your sketch. If you don&apos;t think that sounds good, wait a little while for a stable release of the library :) </para>    </detaileddescription>
