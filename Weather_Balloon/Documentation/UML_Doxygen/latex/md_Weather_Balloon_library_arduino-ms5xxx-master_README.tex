Arduino Library with examples for using digital pressure sensors M\+S5607/\+M\+S5611 (and M\+S56xx, M\+S57xx, M\+S58xx) based on A\+N520 by manufacturer and the datasheets. This library has been tested extensively (over almost a year of datataking) with M\+S5607 and also tested newer \hyperlink{class_m_s5611}{M\+S5611} sensors. Note the different I2\+C-\/addresses, calculations and correction functions between the different chips. One generic M\+S5xxx-\/class as well as a derived class \hyperlink{class_m_s5611}{M\+S5611} with the new I2C address and the new calculations have been implemented.

The examples nicely show how to use this library with the standard M\+S5xxx-\/class. For usage with \hyperlink{class_m_s5611}{M\+S5611} chips just use the class \hyperlink{class_m_s5611}{M\+S5611} in the same way. \char`\"{}\+Standard units\char`\"{} are Pascals for pressure and 0.\+01 Â°C for temperature as calculations are done exactly as shown in the manufacturers datasheet.
