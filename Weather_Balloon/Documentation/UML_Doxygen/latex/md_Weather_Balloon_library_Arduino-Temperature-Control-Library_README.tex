\subsection*{Usage}

This library supports the following devices \+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item D\+S18\+B20
\item D\+S18\+S20 -\/ Please note there appears to be an issue with this series.
\item D\+S1822
\item D\+S1820
\end{DoxyItemize}

You will need a pull-\/up resistor of about 5 K\+Ohm between the 1-\/\+Wire data line and your 5V power. If you are using the D\+S18\+B20, ground pins 1 and 3. The centre pin is the data line \textquotesingle{}1-\/wire\textquotesingle{}.

We have included a \char`\"{}\+R\+E\+Q\+U\+I\+R\+E\+S\+N\+E\+W\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+R\+E\+Q\+U\+I\+R\+E\+S\+A\+L\+A\+R\+M\+S\char`\"{} definition. If you want to slim down the code feel free to use either of these by including

\begin{DoxyVerb}#define REQUIRESNEW 
\end{DoxyVerb}


or \begin{DoxyVerb}#define REQUIRESALARMS
\end{DoxyVerb}

\subsection*{Credits}

The \hyperlink{class_one_wire}{One\+Wire} code has been derived from \href{http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/OneWire}{\tt http\+://www.\+arduino.\+cc/playground/\+Learning/\+One\+Wire}. Miles Burton \href{mailto:miles@mnetcs.com}{\tt miles@mnetcs.\+com} originally developed this library. Tim Newsome \href{mailto:nuisance@casualhacker.net}{\tt nuisance@casualhacker.\+net} added support for multiple sensors on the same bus. Guil Barros \mbox{[}\href{mailto:gfbarros@bappos.com}{\tt gfbarros@bappos.\+com}\mbox{]} added get\+Temp\+By\+Address (v3.\+5) Rob Tillaart \mbox{[}\href{mailto:rob.tillaart@gmail.com}{\tt rob.\+tillaart@gmail.\+com}\mbox{]} added async modus (v3.\+7.\+0)
